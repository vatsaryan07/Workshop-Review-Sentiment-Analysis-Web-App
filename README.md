# Workshop-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-Web-App

Greetings! 

The following repository contains the files for the deployment of the Sentiment Analysis model developed by me for the Inception 5.0 workshop as a simple Flask App. 

For the same, I have used the IMDB 50k review dataset and attempted to shift the intuition for detecting a positive or negative workshop review response using various NLP techniques such as POS Tagging on Tokenized sentences, Bag Of Words creation of adjectives, outlier removal and fine tuning, capped off with the use of a simple Naive Bayes model from the NLTK module. 

The construction and explanation of the same were done during the course of the workshop held on 19-20th March 2021. For reference I have also included the Python Notebook used for the creation of the model. 

Keep in mind that the model developed and techniques used were so used for ease of explanation and implementation for beginners. A more detailed approach and a more thorough model shall be coming soon!
